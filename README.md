#During the pasts weeks we worked with the tool of Colaboratories, we made use of statsitcs and learned how to apply teorical concepts into practial coding. In my personal experience i had a hard time with this subject; since I am not really good with codes. I must say this subject was a complete challenge for me, however, with the help given during class and in extra hours I was ablle to understand the topics and accomplish the tasks.
#Finally, I think that the most interesting thing I learned was the way of analysing large tables of content and represent results thorugh different stastical resources.
